# Warren Event Map

The goal of this project is to build an Event Map that Warren supporters & volunteers can use to find events near their area!  It loads the events via the Mobilize API ([docs for /events endpoint](https://github.com/mobilizeamerica/api#request-2)).

## Working version

The event map is now live at [https://techforwarren.github.io/eventmap/](https://techforwarren.github.io/eventmap/)! Future merges to the `gh-pages` branch will update this site.

## Getting Started - Cloning & Installation

You can clone the GitHub repo or download it from the repo page. After it is on your local machine, be sure to run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Running App - `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Exporting For Github Pages - `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
